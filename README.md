# Hr_Dashboard_POWERBI_Project

Objective- In the HR dashboard project, our primary goal is to create an informative dashboard that visually presents demographic and employee details of the workforce. This dashboard will serve as a powerful tool for HR professionals and decision-makers to gain insights into the employee population and make informed decisions regarding human resources. Key features and visualizations in the dashboard may include employee demographics, recruitment sources, marital status, reasons for termination, and employment status. These visualizations will help HR teams better understand the composition of their workforce and identify areas that may require attention or improvement.

 
key insights from the visualization:

1. Approximately 57% of the employees in the dataset are females.

2. About 44% of the employees are not married.

3. The top recruitment source for employees is Indeed.

4. The majority of employees in the dataset belong to the White racial group.

5. The primary reason for employee terminations is another job offer.

6. Most employee terminations are voluntary in nature.
